# Spider

Web crawler made as a project for the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) Back-End Developer course.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun spider [URL]
```

Spider will recursively search the provided url for links to other pages on the same site, and print a report.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.18. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
